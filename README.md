## User Stories

•	As a new UCF student, having a visualization of the large number of classes I need to take would help immensely to structure my next few semesters.

•	As a busy student, being able to see prerequisites for all future classes without having to go through dozens of web pages would help cut down on the time it takes to enroll.

•	  As an interested student I would like a tool that would show the descriptions for classes in a neat and efficient manner, without having to search through the myUCF website.
